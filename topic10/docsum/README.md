# Project: Python LLMs


## What my docsum.py file does:
This project focuses on understanding how to use LLMs from Python. My ```docsum.py``` file takes either a file path or a url as a command line argument, then summarizes its contents using the Groq API. It can work with ordinary text documents, html files, pdf files, and images (both stored locally and inside URLs). 


## How to run my docsum.py file:
```
$ python3 topic10/docsum/docs/news-mx.html
```
```
$ python3 topic10/docsum/docs/constitution-mx.txt
```
```
$ python3 topic10/docsum/docs/research_paper.pdf
```
```
$ python3 https://elpais.com/us/
```
```
$ python3 https://www.cmc.edu/sites/default/files/about/images/20170213-cube.jpg
